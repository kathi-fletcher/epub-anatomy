In humans the DNA is organized into 46 chromosomes.</figcaption><span class="media" id="fs-id1254484" data-alt="This figure shows a double helix."> <img src="../resources/200_DNA_Double_Helix-02.jpg" data-mime-type="image/jpg" alt="This figure shows a double helix." width="500"/> </span> </figure><p class="para" id="fs-id2033651">The smallest, most fundamental material components of the human body are basic chemical elements. In fact, chemicals called nucleotide bases are the foundation of the genetic code with the instructions on how to build and maintain the human body from conception through old age. There are about three billion of these base pairs in human DNA.</p> <p class="para" id="fs-id1478322">Human chemistry includes organic molecules (carbon-based) and biochemicals (those produced by the body). Human chemistry also includes elements. In fact, life cannot exist without many of the elements that are part of the earth. All of the elements that contribute to chemical reactions, to the transformation of energy, and to electrical activity and muscle contraction&#8212;elements that include phosphorus, carbon, sodium, and calcium, to name a few&#8212;originated in stars.</p> <p class="para" id="fs-id1406290">These elements, in turn, can form both the inorganic and organic chemical compounds important to life, including, for example, water, glucose, and proteins. This chapter begins by examining elements and how the structures of atoms, the basic units of matter, determine the characteristics of elements by the number of protons, neutrons, and electrons in the atoms. The chapter then builds the framework of life from there.</p> </body>
