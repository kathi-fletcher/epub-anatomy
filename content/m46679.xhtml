    >In this chapter, you will explore the remarkable pump that propels the blood into the vessels. There is no single better word to describe the function of the heart other than &#x201C;pump,&#x201D; since its contraction develops the pressure that ejects blood into the major vessels: the aorta and pulmonary trunk. From these vessels, the blood is distributed to the remainder of the body. Although the connotation of the term &#x201C;pump&#x201D; suggests a mechanical device made of steel and plastic, the anatomical structure is a living, sophisticated muscle. As you read this chapter, try to keep these twin concepts in mind: pump and muscle.</p

    >Although the term &#x201C;heart&#x201D; is an English word, cardiac (heart-related) terminology can be traced back to the Latin term, &#x201C;kardia.&#x201D; Cardiology is the study of the heart, and cardiologists are the physicians who deal primarily with the heart.</p
