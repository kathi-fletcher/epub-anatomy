The educated class of subsequent societies studied Latin and Greek, and therefore the early pioneers of anatomy continued to apply Latin and Greek terminology or roots when they named the skeletal muscles. The large number of muscles in the body and unfamiliar words can make learning the names of the muscles in the body seem daunting, but understanding the etymology can help. Etymology is the study of how the root of a particular word entered a language and how the use of the word evolved over time. Taking the time to learn the root of the words is crucial to understanding the vocabulary of anatomy and physiology. When you understand the names of muscles it will help you remember where the muscles are located and what they do (<a href="#fig-ch11_02_01" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, <a href="#fig-ch11_02_02" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>, and <a href="#tbl-ch11_02" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). Pronunciation of words and terms will take a bit of time to master, but after you have some basic information; the correct names and pronunciations will become easier.</p><figure id="fig-ch11_02_01"><figcaption><div class="title">Overview of the Muscular System </div>On the anterior and posterior views of the muscular system above, superficial muscles (those at the surface) are shown on the right side of the body while deep muscles (those underneath the superficial muscles) are shown on the left half of the body.

These include naming the muscle after its shape, its size compared to other muscles in the area, its location in the body or the location of its attachments to the skeleton, how many origins it has, or its action.</p> <p class="para" id="fs-id1290061">The skeletal muscle&#8217;s anatomical location or its relationship to a particular bone often determines its name. For example, the frontalis muscle is located on top of the frontal bone of the skull. Similarly, the shapes of some muscles are very distinctive and the names, such as orbicularis, reflect the shape. For the buttocks, the size of the muscles influences the names: gluteus <span class="term">maximus</span> (largest), gluteus <span class="term">medius</span> (medium), and the gluteus <span class="term">minimus</span> (smallest). Names were given to indicate length&#8212;<span class="term">brevis</span> (short), <span class="term">longus</span> (long)&#8212;and to identify position relative to the midline: <span class="term">lateralis</span> (to the outside away from the midline), and <span class="term">medialis</span> (toward the midline). The direction of the muscle fibers and fascicles are used to describe muscles relative to the midline, such as the <span class="term">rectus</span> (straight) abdominis, or the <span class="term">oblique</span> (at an angle) muscles of the abdomen.</p> <p class="para" id="fs-id2762982">Some muscle names indicate the number of muscles in a group. One example of this is the quadriceps, a group of four muscles located on the anterior (front) thigh. Other muscle names can provide information as to how many origins a particular muscle has, such as the biceps brachii. The prefix <span class="term">bi</span> indicates that the muscle has two origins and <span class="term">tri</span> indicates three origins.</p> <p class="para" id="fs-id2279191">The location of a muscle&#8217;s attachment can also appear in its name. When the name of a muscle is based on the attachments, the origin is always named first. For instance, the sternocleidomastoid muscle of the neck has a dual origin on the sternum (sterno) and clavicle (cleido), and it inserts on the mastoid process of the temporal bone. The last feature by which to name a muscle is its action. When muscles are named for the movement they produce, one can find action words in their name. Some examples are <span class="term">flexor</span> (decreases the angle at the joint), <span class="term">extensor</span> (increases the angle at the joint), <span class="term">abductor</span> (moves the bone away from the midline), or <span class="term">adductor</span> (moves the bone toward the midline).</p> <div class="section" data-class="summary"><h1 class="title" id="fs-id2134693">Chapter Review</h1> <p class="para" id="fs-id2592756">Muscle names are based on many characteristics. The location of a muscle in the body is important. Some muscles are named based on their size and location, such as the gluteal muscles of the buttocks. Other muscle names can indicate the location in the body or bones with which the muscle is associated, such as the tibialis anterior. The shapes of some muscles are distinctive; for example, the direction of the muscle fibers is used to describe muscles of the body midline. The origin and/or insertion can also be features used to name a muscle; examples are the biceps brachii, triceps brachii, and the pectoralis major.</p> </div> <div class="section" data-class="multiple-choice"><h1 class="title" id="fs-id1906439">Review Questions</h1> <div class="exercise" id="fs-id4354529"> <div class="problem" id="fs-id1897868"><p class="para" id="fs-id1616273">The location of a muscle&#8217;s insertion and origin can determine ________.</p> <ol class="list" data-id="fs-id2430153" data-list-type="enumerated" data-number-style="lower-alpha"> <li class="item">action</li> <li class="item">the force of contraction</li> <li class="item">muscle name</li> <li class="item">the load a muscle can carry</li> </ol> </div> <div class="solution" id="fs-id2761379" data-label=""> <p class="para" id="fs-id2506846">A</p> </div> </div> <div class="exercise" id="fs-id2525672"> <div class="problem" id="fs-id2653395"><p class="para" id="fs-id2519231">Where is the temporalis muscle located?</p> <ol class="list" data-id="fs-id2830198" data-list-type="enumerated" data-number-style="lower-alpha"> <li class="item">on the forehead</li> <li class="item">in the neck</li> <li class="item">on the side of the head</li> <li class="item">on the chin</li> </ol> </div> <div class="solution" id="fs-id2594068" data-label=""> <p class="para" id="fs-id2449669">C</p> </div> </div> <div class="exercise" id="fs-id2109061"> <div class="problem" id="fs-id2741146"><p class="para" id="fs-id2132435">Which muscle name does <em class="emphasis" data-effect="italics">not </em>make sense?</p> <ol class="list" data-id="fs-id2927153" data-list-type="enumerated" data-number-style="lower-alpha"> <li class="item">extensor digitorum</li> <li class="item">gluteus minimus</li> <li class="item">biceps femoris</li> <li class="item">extensor minimus longus</li> </ol> </div> <div class="solution" id="fs-id2488022" data-label=""> <p class="para" id="fs-id2271863">D</p> </div> </div> <div class="exercise" id="fs-id2365924"> <div class="problem" id="fs-id2416756"><p class="para" id="fs-id2143484">Which of the following terms would be used in the name of a muscle that moves the leg away from the body?</p> <ol class="list" data-id="fs-id2079731" data-list-type="enumerated" data-number-style="lower-alpha"> <li class="item">flexor</li> <li class="item">adductor</li> <li class="item">extensor</li> <li class="item">abductor</li> </ol> </div> <div class="solution" id="fs-id2787580" data-label=""> <p class="para" id="fs-id2761928">D</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="section" data-class="free-response"><h1 class="title" id="fs-id1587850">Critical Thinking Questions</h1> <div class="exercise" id="fs-id2279054"> <div class="problem" id="fs-id2353862"><p class="para" id="fs-id2006432">Describe the different criteria that contribute to how skeletal muscles are named.</p></div> <div class="solution" id="fs-id2572688" data-label=""> <p class="para" id="fs-id2493842">In anatomy and physiology, many word roots are Latin or Greek.
